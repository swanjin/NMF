\title{Successive projection algorithm for separable NMF}
\usage{
spa(X, r, options = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{X}{an m-by-n matrix.
Ideally admitting a near-separable factorization, that is, X = WH + N, where

conv([W, 0]) has r vertices,

H = [I,H']P where I is the identity matrix, H'>= 0 and its
columns sum to at most one, P is a permutation matrix, and

N is sufficiently small.}

\item{r}{number of columns to be extracted.}

\item{options}{list of string
if options contain

"normalize" := 1, will scale the columns of X so that they sum to one,
hence matrix H will satisfy the assumption above for any
nonnegative separable matrix X.

"normalize" := 0, is the default value for which no scaling is
performed. For example, in hyperspectral imaging, this
assumption is already satisfied and normalization is not
necessary.

"precision" : stops the algorithm when
max_k ||R(:,k)||_2 <= relerror * max_k ||X(:,k)||_2
where R is the residual, that is, R = X-X(:,K)H.
default: 1e-6}
}
\value{
\code{K} index set of the extracted columns.
}
\description{
At each step of the algorithm, the column of R maximizing ||.||_2 is
extracted, and R is updated by projecting its columns onto the orthogonal
complement of the extracted column. The residual R is initializd with X.
